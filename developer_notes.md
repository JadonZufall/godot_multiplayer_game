# Importing Models
## Error import all resources in a model
The example that I have for this is with my humanoid model.  I was attempting to reimport the model and I checked the skip import box for the two eye bones.
This caused neither eye to be properly imported, however when I unchecked them to import them again, only the right eye would import properly.  This issue was
solved when I set a save path for the meshes.  Not sure if this should actually be required but it was a quick fix that I had come up with.  I am also not sure
if using .blend files and importing directly from them is a good idea but I will need to do more reasearch to find that out.
